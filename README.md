# About
https://www.born-gifted.org/
The AEC Special Education Club is committed to creating a platform and network of resources for children with learning disabilities.

Our club regularly hosts both online and offline activities to encourage volunteers to take practical steps in supporting children with learning disabilities and advocating for their needs from multiple perspectives. Through a variety of methods, including our website and social media platforms, we aim to raise awareness of special education, highlight the individuals who benefit from it, and showcase the challenges faced by children with learning disabilities.

Additionally, our club maintains strong relationships with doctors and psychologists, allowing us to launch collaborative initiatives to assist both children with learning difficulties and the general public to contribute as much as we can to the world.

# Mission
AEC Special Education Club is a group of passionate individuals committed to creating a supportive platform and network of resources for children with learning disabilities from Perceiver.co. Our club works tirelessly to raise awareness about the unique challenges faced by these children and to advocate for their needs from multiple perspectives. Through a variety of online and offline activities, we encourage volunteers to take practical steps in supporting children with learning disabilities. We also work closely with doctors and psychologists to launch collaborative initiatives aimed at helping these children and the general public to contribute as much as possible to the world.

Our primary goal right now is to create a website for special education children to showcase their artistic talents and abilities. We believe that many of these children possess unique talents that often go unnoticed or unappreciated. By providing a platform for them to share their artworks and talents, we hope to bring attention to their abilities and encourage the world to celebrate and support these children.

As the president of the AEC Special Education Club, I am committed to this goal and believe that it is a crucial step in helping these children achieve their full potential. We hope to continue our work in promoting special education and supporting children with learning disabilities in the future.
